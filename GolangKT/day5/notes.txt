 1. Create a slice, demonstrate shallow copy and deep copy on in 
    {
        -Shallow Copy: Copies references, so changes to one copy can affect the original.
        -Deep Copy: Copies the actual data so that the original and copy are independent.
        -Go doesnâ€™t have a built-in deep copy function for complex types; you must manually implement it for each field.
